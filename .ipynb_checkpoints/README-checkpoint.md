Welcome to the Big Ideas Skills Lab 6 repository, where we will be presenting our Python program that serves as a four-function calculator. Our team, consisting of Ayan Shah, Rohil Kapur, and Sid Surana, has collaborated to develop this program to meet the project's requirements.

The primary function of our program is to take user input for their name, two numbers, and the desired operation to be performed. The program then performs the selected operation on the two numbers and displays the resulting value. Additionally, we have implemented a "Quit" option, which can be accessed by pressing the "Q" key to exit the program.

Our program's functionality is achieved through Python programming language. We have utilized Python's built-in functions, such as "input()" for user input, "print()" for output, and various mathematical operators, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, to execute the mathematical operations.

We have designed our program to be interactive by greeting the user upon inputting their name, which adds a personal touch and enhances the user experience. 

In conclusion, our program serves as a robust, user-friendly, and interactive four-function calculator, which meets the project's requirements. Our team has leveraged Python's built-in functions and mathematical operators to achieve this functionality.
