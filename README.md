# paris-6
This repository is for our Big Ideas Skills Lab 6. We must write a python program that takes a name input, another type of input, and it does something with this other input. The members participating are Ayan Shah, Rohil Kapur, and Sid Surana.
The program we are writing is a four-function calculator that asks the user to input their name, two numbers, and the operation they want to do. We also added a quit option by pressing the "Q" key. The code prints out a greeting to the user once their name is inputed, and it also prints out the result from whatever operation the user wants to perform on the two numbers entered.
